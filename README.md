# About
This game will be a WebSockets baed competitive tetris game. Currently, I am working on the implementation for the base game.

# Game algorithm
  * Generate a piece
  * Have the piece move down rows one tick at a time until it collides with board edge or placed pieces
    * If up pressed, change orientation of piece
    * If left or right pressed, move piece one column unless this moves it out of bounds
    * If down pressed, increase tick rate
    * If space pressed, immediately collide vertically and continue
  * Add piece to placed pieces
  * If placed pieces now out of bounds, end game due to loss
  * Remove 0 <= n <= 4 completed rows, increment score by n, and shift down all rows above n
  * Repeat until game end

# Key words / ideas

  * piece
  * placed pieces
    * cells
  * row
  * column
  * collision
  * tick (time)
  * board edge
  * orientation of piece
  * keypress

# TODO
  * Refactor to allow generalizability
    * Of height/width, i.e., number of cells in board
    * Of height/width, i.e., size of cells in board

# CRA details

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
